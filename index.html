          Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake
          recipe! Paired with a buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny
          its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water bath.

      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <div>
        <h5>1</h5>
        <p>
          Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to
          350°F (177°C).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>2</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the crust:</strong> Using a food processor, pulse the
          graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar
          and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together
          in the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the
          bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform
          pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring
          cup to pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove
          from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil.
          The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow
          crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>3</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the filling:</strong> Using a handheld or stand mixer
          fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated
          sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture
          is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla
          extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium
          speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until
          just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter,
          stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and
          cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>4</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot
          of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water
          bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot
          water. As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the
          springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a
          rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan
          inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of
          the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in
          the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for
          you.)
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>5</h5>
        <p>
          Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set.
          When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if
          you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door
          slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it
          cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool
          cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the
          cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>6</h5>
        <p>
          Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the
          springform pan, then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut
          into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip
          into warm water between each slice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h5>7</h5>
        <p>
          Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
          cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
        </p>
